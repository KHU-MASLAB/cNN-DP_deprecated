# cNN-DP: Composite neural network with differential propagation for impulsive nonlinear dynamics
In mechanical engineering, abundant, high-quality data from simulations and experimental observations enables the development of practical and accurate data-driven models. However, when dynamics are complex and highly nonlinear, it is still an issue to design a suitable model and optimize it accurately. In particular, when data consists of impulsive signals or high-frequency components, it becomes increasingly challenging to train a data-driven model.
We propose a novel and robust composite neural network for impulsive time-transient dynamics. It breaks the prediction of the dynamics into three sub-networks, one for approximating simplified dynamics and the other two for mapping lower-order derivatives to higher-order derivatives. The latter serves as the temporal differential operator, giving the name of 'composite neural network with differential propagation (cNN-DP)' to the suggested model. 
Numerical investigations compare cNN-DP with two baseline models, a conventional network and another employing the autogradient approach. Regarding the convergence rate of model optimizations and the generalization accuracy, the proposed network outperforms the baseline models by many orders of magnitude. In terms of computational efficiency, numerical tests demonstrate that cNN-DP requires an acceptable and comparable computational load. Though the numerical studies and descriptions are focused on accelerations, the proposed network can be easily extended to any other applications involving impulsive data.
